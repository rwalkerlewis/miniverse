--- AGENT CLINICAL DECISIONS ---

Dr. Emily Wilson (dr_wilson):
  Action: work
  Target: patient_01
  Parameters: {'task': 'monitor_patient'}
  ** TASK: monitor_patient **
  Clinical Reasoning: Patient 01 is currently critical with an average patient health score of 57.2, indicating a moderate to severe condition. Initial monitoring and assessment are necessary before proceeding with further interventions.

Sarah Martinez (nurse_sarah):
  Action: work
  Target: patient_a
  Parameters: {'task': 'monitor_patient'}
  ** TASK: monitor_patient **
  Clinical Reasoning: Patient A is critical with an average patient health score of 57.2, indicating a need for close monitoring and intervention.

James Chen (nurse_james):
  Action: work
  Target: patient_c
  Parameters: {'task': 'monitor_patient'}
  ** TASK: monitor_patient **
  Clinical Reasoning: Patient C has been showing moderate signs of respiratory distress and requires close monitoring to ensure stability.

Patricia Anderson (nurse_patricia):
  Action: work
  Target: patient_f
  Parameters: {'task': 'monitor_patient'}
  ** TASK: monitor_patient **
  Clinical Reasoning: Patient F is in critical condition with a low average patient health score. Immediate monitoring is required to prevent any potential deterioration.
