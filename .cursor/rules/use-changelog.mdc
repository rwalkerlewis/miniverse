# Changelog Usage

- **Document all changes** - Update `CHANGELOG.md` for every PR with meaningful changes
- **Use conventional format** - Follow "Added", "Changed", "Fixed", "Removed" sections
- **Include PR references** - Link to PR numbers for traceability
- **Group by version** - Organize entries under version headers with dates
