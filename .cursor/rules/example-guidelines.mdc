# Example Guidelines

## Example Structure
- **Progressive complexity** - Start simple, add features incrementally (workshop pattern: 01, 02, 03...)
- **Module docstring explains** - WHAT THIS SHOWS (key concepts), RUN (exact command with `uv run`)
- **Self-contained** - Each example runs independently with minimal dependencies
- **Inline comments explain WHY** - Use section separators (`# ===`) and explain design decisions, not just what code does
- **Show both modes** - Demonstrate deterministic AND LLM versions where applicable (like workshop/run.py)
- **Working examples only** - All examples must run successfully with `uv run python -m examples.path.to.example`

## Example Categories
- **workshop/** - Progressive tutorial series (01_hello_world → 05_stochastic)
- **smallville/** - Stanford Generative Agents replication scenarios
- **{domain}/** - Domain-specific examples (snake, etc.)

## Documentation
- Each example directory has README.md explaining the concept
- Code comments explain key patterns and design decisions
- Keep examples focused on teaching one concept at a time
