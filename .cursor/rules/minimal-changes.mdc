# Minimal Changes Principle

- **Change only what's necessary** - Make the smallest possible change to achieve the goal
- **No refactoring unrelated code** - Don't rewrite, rename, or restructure code that works fine
- **No file renames** - Unless explicitly requested, don't rename files or move code around
- **No style changes** - Don't reformat, reorder imports, or change variable names unless required
- **No "improvements"** - Don't add optimizations, error handling, or features not requested
- **Preserve existing patterns** - Follow the existing code style and architecture, don't impose new patterns
- **One change per task** - Focus on a single, specific change rather than multiple improvements
