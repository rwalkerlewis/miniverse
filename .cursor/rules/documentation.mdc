# Documentation Standards

- **Every module, class, and public function needs a docstring** - Explain what it does, why it exists, and key design decisions
- **Explain WHY, not WHAT** - Code shows what it does; comments explain rationale, design decisions, and non-obvious logic
- **Use Field descriptions** - All Pydantic fields must have `description=` parameter
- **Update docs with code changes** - When changing features, update README.md, CLAUDE.md, and docs/ as needed
- **No redundant or stale comments** - Delete outdated comments and don't repeat what code obviously does
