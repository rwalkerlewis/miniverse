# Research Documentation

This directory contains research findings that inform the Varela project architecture and design decisions.

## Research Areas

### 1. [LLM Agent Simulations](agent-simulations/)
Recent advances in multi-agent systems powered by large language models, including memory architectures, social behavior modeling, and scaling approaches.

### 2. [Mars Colonization & Space Settlements](mars-colonization/)
Agent-based models of space colonization focusing on sociotechnical dynamics, personality factors, and organizational coordination under extreme constraints.

### 3. [Game Engines & 2D Simulation](game-engines/)
Technical approaches to building simulation environments, 2D game engines suitable for research, and visualization strategies.

### 4. [Technical Implementation](technical/)
Structured outputs, JSON schema design, state management patterns, and branching narrative systems.

## Research Timeline

- **January 2025**: Initial research phase
- **Key Focus**: 2024-2025 publications showing mature LLM agent systems

## Key Insights Summary

1. **LLM agents can exhibit believable social behavior** at scale (25-10,000+ agents validated)
2. **Sociotechnical modeling is proven effective** for Mars colonization scenarios (minimum 22 agents required)
3. **2D engines are sufficient** for organizational/coordination dynamics (full physics not required)
4. **Structured state management** with JSON schemas enables consistent LLM-driven world evolution
5. **Branching narratives** are well-established patterns in interactive storytelling and scenario planning

## Next Steps

- Deep dive into game engine technical tradeoffs
- Design JSON schemas for world state
- Prototype agent architecture
- Build "Loom" branching mechanism
