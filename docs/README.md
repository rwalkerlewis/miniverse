# Documentation Index

- `RESEARCH.md` – curated reading list and links that inspired the hybrid design.
- `research/` – deeper research notes (kept verbatim from earlier explorations).
- `architecture/` – detailed explanations of the cognition stack and environment tiers.
- `USAGE.md` – step-by-step guide for building simulations with Miniverse (explicit templates, prompt injection, comms model, world updates, testing).
- `examples/PLAN.md` – roadmap for upcoming simulations (Stanford replication, Mars habitat, etc.).
- `archive/` – historical documents retained for reference; they do not mirror the current API.

The root `README.md` provides quickstart and links back here. `CLAUDE.md` captures contributor guidelines.
